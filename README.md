# StudyBuddy
### About
StudyBuddy is a website that I helped to create as part of a group during Vodafone's CodeLikeAGirl work experience programme. The website offers revision-based tips aimed at students studying for their GCSEs or A-Levels. There is a variety of information on the website including links to tried and tested study resources that we found useful whilst we were studying for exams ourselves.

### Motivation
We decided to create a study website as the world of revision can be very overwhelming and confusing with many conflicting opinions. We wanted to put together a list of useful resources that others could use if they were at a loss of where to go for advice. This also helped us as it allowed us to put our own skills to the test so we also learnt a lot along the way. I have since personally updated the website and changed the appearance of some elements as I feel this was necessary to keep it easy and clear to use.
